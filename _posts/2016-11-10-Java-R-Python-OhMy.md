title: "Java, R, and Python - Oh my!"

I am now fully underway into the M.S. program in Bioinformatics through Johns Hopkins University's Advanced Academic
Programs. Against my better judgment, this semester I decided to attempt a three-course schedule while working full time. While
I fell short and was forced to drop one due to time constraints, it taught me a lot about my own limits. Namely, that I am not a robot,
 and that sleeping, eating, and breathing are important. More importantly, it taught me how to read the writing on the wall - when 
 a professor says "I recommend this course be taken on its own" in the syllabus, a lecture, and office hours, take her advice.

You may have won the battle, Data Structures, but you haven't won the war.

That said, I continue brushing up on my Java basics, learning R in the context of microarray and sequencing data analysis, and
Python on my own. And Javascript. And Russian. I guess I can breathe and sleep at the same time, right?
