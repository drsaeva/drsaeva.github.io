<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am David R. Saeva, a coding afficionado looking to break into the dev
world. My <a href="/CV">background</a> is in Biochemistry and I have a little
experience working with large datasets, most recently using ad hoc Perl
scripting and relational databases for the purpose of supporting
<a href= "https://github.com/drsaeva/utr-analysis">RNA and cancer biology
research</a>. Currently, I'm learning Java and OOP through
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">Coursera</a>
while brushing up on my HTML/CSS and Javascript on the side. Long term, I plan to
also to learn node.js and AngularJS.
<br />
Outside of programming, I enjoy cooking, jazz, and hiking with my German Shepherd, Tank.
