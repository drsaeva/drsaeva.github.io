<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am David R. Saeva, a coding afficionado looking to break into the dev
world. My <a href="/CV">background</a> is in Biochemistry and I have a little
experience working with large datasets. In a recent project, I used ad hoc Perl
scripting and relational databases for the purpose of supporting
<a href= "https://github.com/drsaeva/utr-analysis">RNA and cancer biology
research</a>. Currently, I'm learning Java and OOP through
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">Coursera</a>
while brushing up on my HTML/CSS and Javascript on the side. Long-term, I am
considering options including (but not limited to) C#, node.js, and AngularJS.</p>
<br />
<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy cooking, jazz, and hiking with my German
Shepherd, Tank.</p>
