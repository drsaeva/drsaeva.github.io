---

I am David R. Saeva, a young dev looking to break into the coding world. My
<a href="/CV">background</a> is in Biochemistry and I have a little experience
in working with large datasets, most recently using ad hoc Perl scripting and
relational databases for the purpose of supporting
[RNA and cancer biology research](https://github.com/drsaeva/utr-analysis).
