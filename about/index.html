<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am David R. Saeva, a novice programmer looking to break into the dev
world. My <a href="/CV">background</a> is in Biochemistry and I have a little
experience working with <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/je500053c">
large</a> <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jced.5b00503">
datasets</a>. Circa Fall 2015, I used
<a href= "https://github.com/drsaeva/utr-analysis">ad-hoc Perl scripting</a> and
 relational databases for the purpose of supporting research on translational regulation of
 genes in cancer. </p>
 
 <p>Currently, I'm employed by a state health department, for whom I do a 
 mixture of data entry, QA, and <a href="https://github.com/drsaeva/labBot">software 
 development</a>. I'm also a Masters student in the Bioinformatics program 
 at <a href="http://advanced.jhu.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/bioinformatics/"> 
 Johns Hopkins University</a>, for which  I've also <a href="https://github.com/drsaeva/Coursework-Scripts">
 written some scripts</a>  in order to <em>optimize</em> myefforts with coursework.
 </p>

<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy cooking, jazz, and hiking with my German
Shepherd, Tank.</p>
