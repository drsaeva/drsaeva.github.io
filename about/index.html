<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am David R. Saeva, a novice programmer looking to break into the dev
world. My <a href="/CV">background</a> is in Biochemistry and I have a little
experience working with <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/je500053c">
large</a> <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jced.5b00503">
datasets</a>. In a recent project, I used
<a href= "https://github.com/drsaeva/utr-analysis">ad hoc Perl scripting</a> and
 relational databases for the purpose of supporting research on translational regulation of
 genes in cancer. Currently, I'm learning Java and OOP through
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">Coursera</a>
while brushing up on my HTML/CSS and Javascript on the side.</p>
<br />
<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy cooking, jazz, and hiking with my German
Shepherd, Tank.</p>
