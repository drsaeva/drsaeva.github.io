title: "Github site update time?"

Over the past two days I've been testing how minor changes to the css and
structural html files will impact this site's layout. I'm pretty new to
HTML5/CSS3, so this has been great practice (and more interesting than redoing
Code Academy, etc. exercises - no offense Code Academy!).

However, when I use the Github desktop client, my commits always seem to take
much longer to impact the outcome of the site than if I were to use Github's
online editor. I wonder what the cause is - is it latency-driven? Some quirk
resulting from the interaction of the desktop client with Github's site?
